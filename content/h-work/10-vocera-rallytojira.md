### Vocera - Rally to JIRA Migration

We implemented the migration of historical project management data from Rally to JIRA. 

This project was particularly challenging because the project organization, workflow, data types and schemas between the 2 systems were very distinct. Adding to the challenge was the sheer volume of data that had to be migrated and the customizations tailored per project team.

We have successfully migrated around 34 projects containing a total of 108,000 artifacts including attachments, without disrupting the project teams ability to perform their daily jobs.

**Technologies/Tools:** Ruby, NodeJS, CSVKit, Ubuntu, Rally, JIRA, Bash Scripting, Handwritten ETL migrations scripts, Various stream based NodeJs libraries.
